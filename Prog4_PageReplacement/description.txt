task1:
when the frame only 1, the fault should be the same for each algo, becasue when it has fault, it has to change
when the frame is small, the OPT algo will get the smaller fault then LRU, since OPT will know the one not used in the future
when the frame is large, each algo will the same, since frame has enough space for page, fault will be reduced.

task2:
the timer based takes more time than stack,
becasue the timer LRU algo needed to search the whole counter list and update the timer for page when the page is referred
and the stack based only need to push the new one to the top when it referred a page not in the frame
